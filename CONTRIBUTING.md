# Working on terragucci

```bash
npm install
just check      # what CI runs: typecheck, lint, tests, the docs' prose and the tutorial
just site-dev   # serve the docs locally
```

## The package

`packages/terragucci` is `@intentius/terragucci`, the `terragucci` command. `just build-cli` bundles it into one file, `dist/terragucci.mjs`, with no runtime dependencies; chant is a build dependency of this repo only. `just bundle-check`, part of `just check`, fails if the package gains a dependency, the bundle passes its size budget, or it imports anything but Node's modules and the optional TypeScript folder that a `terragucci.ts` config needs. `npm pack` in that directory builds the tarball; publishing to npm waits for an explicit go.

## The CI images

`images/images.ts` declares one image per toolchain (tofu, terraform, terragrunt) with chant's docker lexicon; `just ci` renders `images/Dockerfile.*`, and `just ci-check` fails on a hand edit. Tool versions come from `packages/terragucci/src/images.ts`, the table `init` reads too.

```bash
just images             # build all three for this machine, into the local daemon
just images-check       # run each image's tools and hold it to images/budget.json
```

The images workflow builds and checks them on amd64 and arm64 for every change, and pushes them to GHCR only for a `v*` tag, which waits for an explicit go. A release then records each pushed digest in `packages/terragucci/src/image-digests.json` before the npm package is built, so `init` pins the images by digest.

## Workflows

Every workflow in this repo is a chant declaration. The YAML is rendered from it and committed, because GitHub reads YAML from the default branch.

```bash
just ci          # render every workflow
just ci-check    # fail if a committed workflow differs from its declaration
```

| Declaration | Rendered |
|---|---|
| `ci/pipeline.ts` | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` |
| `pages/pipeline.ts` | `.github/workflows/pages.yml` |
| `capture/pipeline.ts` | `.github/workflows/capture.yml` |
| `image-ci/pipeline.ts` | `.github/workflows/images.yml` |
| `images/images.ts` | `images/Dockerfile.*` |
| `workflows/shared.ts` | the pins they share |

## The site

`docs-site/` is Astro and Starlight, published at intentius.io/terragucci. `just site` builds it the way the pages workflow does. Its prose is scored with the [sentences](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sentences) linter by `just lint-docs`.

The site is for people using terragucci. It describes the finished product, links no issue tracker, and leaves what is built today to the Status page.

## The example, the checks and the tutorial

`stack/README.md` covers the local stack, `just example`, `just smoke` and `just tutorial-capture`. The capture workflow refreshes the tutorial's output and screenshots weekly and opens a pull request when they change.
